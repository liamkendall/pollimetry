Description: Tools to estimate pollinator body size and co-varying traits: bee tongue length and foraging distances. This package combines novel (described in Kendall et al. 2018) as well as pre-existing predictive allometries for pollinator body size, bee tongue length and foraging distance. Pre-existing body size equations are implemented for a variety of Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera taxa.
