\title{Converts the intertegular distance (ITD) and co-variates to body size in dry weight (mg) for bees or hoverflies.}
\usage{
bodysize(x, taxa, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame with columns containing IT values and Sex ('Male' or 'Female'). 
Optional attributes depending on model choice: Taxonomic family (bees) or subfamily (hoverfly), Region (Only NorthAmerica, SouthAmerica, Australasia and Europe implemented) and Species ("Genus_species")}

\item{taxa}{A vector specifying insect taxa of interest, can be either "bee" for bee models and "hov" for hoverfly models}

\item{type}{A vector specifying model type to be used: for bees this can be either "taxo" for taxonomic models, "phy" for phylogenetic model or "IT" for ITD-only model. In hoverflies: it can either be "h1" for Weight ~ IT + Sex, "h2" for Weight ~ IT * Subfamily + Sex or IT for ITD-only model.}
}
\value{
The original dataframe (x) is returned along with four additional columns: body size (dry weight (mg)), S.E. and 95% confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Calculates body size in dry weight (mg) from Kendall et al. (2018) using ITD (and co-variate) values.
}
\details{
For bees, type option 'taxo' requires ITD, 
sex and taxonomic family.  Type option 'phylo' only requires ITD and Sex to run 
but is only recommended to be used for species (and regions) included in model formulation. 
Please run `setdiff` using `bee_mean_dataset` for region and species to check matches.
 For hoverflies, type 'h1' requires ITD and Sex for each specimen 
 and type 'h2' requires ITD, Sex and subfamily. Type "IT" for both 
 taxa only requires ITD values (Optional: region and species but again check `setdiff`). 
 If specimens are from included regions (see above) or species we recommend 
 including these as additional columns. Estimates (and variance components) are 
 returned as four additional columns bound to the original dataframe.
